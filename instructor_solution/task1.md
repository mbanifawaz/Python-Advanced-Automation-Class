### **Overview of the Code**
This Python script continuously monitors a log file for critical errors. When a "CRITICAL ERROR" message appears in the log, it sends an email alert to a configured recipient. The script ensures that only new log entries are read each time it checks the file.

### **How the Code Works**
1. **Configuration Handling (`configparser`)**  
   - Loads settings from a `config.ini` file.
   - If `config.ini` does not exist, it creates a default one.
   - Stores:
     - SMTP email settings for sending alerts.
     - The log file path to monitor.
     - The interval (in seconds) to check for new logs.

2. **Log Monitoring (`pygtail`)**  
   - Uses `Pygtail` to read only newly added lines from the log file, avoiding reprocessing old entries.
   - Looks for lines containing `"CRITICAL ERROR"`.
   - If found, logs a warning and triggers an email alert.

3. **Email Alerts (`smtplib`, `email`)**  
   - Sends an email using SMTP when a critical error is detected.
   - The email contains the error message and timestamp.
   - Uses `MIMEMultipart` and `MIMEText` to format the email.

4. **Logging (`logging`)**  
   - Logs key events like startup, error detections, and email alerts.
   - Helps track the monitoring process.

5. **Looping Mechanism (`time.sleep()`)**  
   - Keeps running indefinitely, checking the log file every few seconds.
   - Waits between checks to reduce CPU usage.

6. **Graceful Exit (`sys`)**  
   - Captures `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C) to allow clean shutdown.

### **Utilized Python Libraries**
| Library          | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| `os`           | File operations (checking if config/log files exist). |
| `time`         | Controls loop timing (`time.sleep()`). |
| `logging`      | Logs system events and errors. |
| `datetime`     | Adds timestamps to logs and emails. |
| `pygtail`      | Reads only new log lines, avoiding duplicates. |
| `smtplib`      | Sends emails via SMTP. |
| `email`        | Formats emails (`MIMEMultipart`, `MIMEText`). |
| `configparser` | Manages `config.ini` for settings storage. |
| `sys`          | Handles script exit on user interruption. |

This script is useful for real-time log monitoring and automated error reporting. ðŸš€
